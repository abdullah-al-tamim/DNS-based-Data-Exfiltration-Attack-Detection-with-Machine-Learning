# DNS-based-Data-Exfiltration-Attack-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
Attackers often abuse the Domain Name System (DNS) to steal sensitive data from companies and create hidden communication channels with their servers. Companies rely on DNS, so they usually allow it through firewalls, making it vulnerable to data exfiltration. This research proposes a model using specific features to identify both large and small-scale DNS data exfiltration attacks within companies. The model performed well, achieving an F1-score of 87% for detecting attacks and 90% for normal traffic. When classifying attacks further, it reached 90% accuracy for small attacks and a remarkable 94% for large ones. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately detecting and classifying different attack types.
